# Welcome!

Welcome to the Meyer Lab Handbook. 
https://jessegmeyerlab.github.io/Handbook/

The handbook was developed by [Jesse Meyer](https://www.jessemeyerlab.com/our-team) as a guide for current and prospective researchers with resources, guidelines, and information about the Meyer Lab. 

More information on the lab and department can be found through the following resources:

* [The Lab website](https://www.jessemeyerlab.com)
* [MCW Biochemistry Departmental website](https://www.mcw.edu/departments/biochemistry)

This handbook was forked from [Devin Schweppe's](https://www.schweppelab.org/) [handbook](https://schweppelab.github.io/Handbook/index.html), which was adapted from and influenced by several other works from the [ Morey](https://ccmorey.github.io/labHandbook/index.html), [ Peele](https://github.com/jpeelle/peellelab_manual/blob/master/peellelab_manual.pdf), and [Ritchey](http://www.thememolab.org/resources/) groups.
